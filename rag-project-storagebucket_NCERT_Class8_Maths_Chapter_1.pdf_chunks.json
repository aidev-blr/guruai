["RATIONAL  NUMBERS   1\n1.1  Introduction\nIn Mathematics, we frequently come across simple equations to be solved. For example,\nthe equation x + 2 = 13 (1)\nis solved when x = 11, because this value of x satisfies the given equation. The  solution\n11 is a natural number . On the other hand, for the equation\nx + 5 = 5 (2)\nthe solution gives the whole number 0 (zero). If we consider only natural numbers,\nequation (2) cannot be solved. To solve equations like (2), we added the number zero to\nthe collection of natural numbers and obtained the whole numbers. Even whole numbers\nwill not be sufficient to solve equations of type\nx + 18 = 5 (3)\nDo you see \u2018why\u2019? We require the number \u201313 which is not a whole number . This\nled us to think of integers, (positive and negative) . Note that the positive integers\ncorrespond to natural numbers. One may think that we have enough numbers to solve all\nsimple equations with the available list of integers. Now consider the equations\n2x  =3 (4)\n5\nx + 7 = 0 (5)\nfor which we cannot find a solution from the integers . (Check this)\nWe need the numbers 3\n2 to solve equation (4) and 7\n5\u2212\n to solve\nequation (5). This leads us to the collection of rational numbers .\nWe have already seen basic operations on rational\nnumbers. We now try to explore some properties of operations\non the dif ferent types of numbers seen so far .Rational NumbersCHAPTER1\nReprint 2024-25\n", "2  MATHEMA TICS\n1.2  Properties of Rational Numbers\n1.2.1  Closure\n(i)Whole numbers\nLet us revisit the closure property for all the operations on whole numbers in brief.\nOperation Numbers Remarks\nAddition 0 + 5 = 5, a whole number Whole numbers are closed\n4 + 7 = ... .
