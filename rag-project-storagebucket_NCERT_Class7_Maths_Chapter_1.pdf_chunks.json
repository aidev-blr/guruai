["1.1 A Lakh Varieties!\nEshwarappa is a farmer in Chintamani, \na town in Karnataka. He visits the market regularly to buy seeds for his rice field. During one such visit he overheard a conversation between Ramanna and Lakshmamma. Ramanna said, \u201cEarlier our country had about a lakh varieties of rice. Farmers used to preserve different varieties of seeds and use them to grow rice. Now, we only have a handful of varieties. Also, farmers have to come to the market to buy seeds\u201d.\nLakshmamma said, \u201cThere is a seed bank near my house. So far , they \nhave collected about a hundred indigenous varieties of rice seeds from different places. You can also buy seeds from there.\u201d\nYou may have heard the word \u2018lakh\u2019 \nbefore. Do you know how big one lakh is? Let us find out.\nEshwarappa shared this incident with his \ndaughter Roxie and son Estu .\nEstu was surprised to know that there \nwere about one lakh varieties of rice in this country. He wondered \u201cOne lakh! So far I have only tasted 3 varieties. If we tried a new variety each day, would we even come close to tasting all the varieties in a lifetime of 100 years?\u201d\nWhat do you think?
