However, by chance, one day you for get to\ntake the raincoat and it rains heavily on that day .\nSometimes it so happens that a student prepares 4 chapters out of 5, very wellfor a test. But a major question is asked from the chapter that she left unprepared.\nEveryone knows that a particular train runs in time but the day you reach\nwell in time it is late!\nYou face a lot of situations such as these where you take a chance and it\ndoes not go the way you want it to. Can you give some more examples? Theseare examples where the chances of a certain thing happening or not happeningare not equal. The chances of the train being in time or being late are not thesame. When you buy a ticket which is wait listed, you do take a chance. You\nhope that it might get confirmed by the time you travel.\nWe however , consider here certain experiments whose results have an equal chance\nof occurring.\n4.3.1  Getting a result\nYou might have seen that before a cricket match starts, captains of the two teams go out\nto toss a coin to decide which team will bat first.\nWhat are the possible results you get when a coin is tossed? Of course, Head or Tail.\nImagine that you are the captain of one team and your friend is the captain of the other\nteam. You toss a coin and ask your friend to make the call. Can you control the result of\nthe toss? Can you get a head if you want one? Or a tail if you want that? No, that is notpossible. Such an experiment is called a random experiment . Head or Tail are the two\noutcomes of this experiment.\n1.If you try to start a scooter , what are the possible outcomes?\n2.When a die is thrown, what are the six possible outcomes?\nOh!\n my\nraincoat.\nReprint 2024-25\n", "\uf034\uf036\uf020\uf020\uf04d\uf041\uf054\uf048\uf045\uf04d\uf041\uf054\uf049\uf043\uf053\nTHINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE3.When you spin the wheel shown, what are the possible outcomes?

Does it mean that the third player would not\nhave a chance of getting a six?\n4.3.2  Equally likely outcomes:\nA coin is tossed several times and the number of times we get head or tail is noted. Let us\nlook at the result sheet where we keep on increasing the tosses:Fig 4.7Fig 4.6\nNumber of tosses Tally marks (H) Number of heads T ally mark (T) Number of tails\n50 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | 27 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | 23\n| | | |  | | | |  | | | | | |  | | |\n60 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | 28 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | 32\n| | | |  | | | |  | | | | | | |  | | | |  | | | |  | |\n70        ... 33        ... 37\n80        ... 38        ... 42\n90        ... 44        ... 46\n100        ... 48        ... 52\nReprint 2024-25\n", "\uf044\uf041\uf054\uf041\uf020\uf048\uf041\uf04e\uf044\uf04c\uf049\uf04e\uf047\uf020\uf020\uf034\uf037\nObserve that as you increase the number of tosses more and more, the number of\nheads and the number of tails come closer and closer to each other .\nThis could also be done with a die, when tossed a large number of times. Number of\neach of the six outcomes become almost equal  to each other .\nIn such cases, we may say that the different outcomes of the experiment are equally\nlikely . This means that each of the outcomes has the same chance of occurring.\n4.3.3  Linking chances to probability\nConsider the experiment of tossing a coin once. What are the outcomes? There are only\ntwo outcomes \u2013 Head or Tail. Both the outcomes are equally likely . Likelihood of getting\na head is one out of two outcomes, i.e., 1\n2. In other words, we say that the probability of\ngetting a head = 1\n2. What is the probability of getting a tail?\nNow take the example of throwing a die marked with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on its faces (one\nnumber on one face).

Thus, there are six equally likely outcomes.\nWhat is the probability of getting the outcome \u20182\u2019?\nIt is\nWhat is the probability of getting the number 5? What is the probability of getting the\nnumber 7?

A ball is drawn from the bag without looking into the bag.\nWhat is probability of getting a red ball? Is it more or less than getting a yellow ball?\nSolution:   There are in all (4 + 2 =) 6 outcomes of  the event. Getting a red ball\nconsists of 4 outcomes. (Why?)\nTherefore, the probability of getting a red ball is 4\n6= 2\n3. In the same way the probability\nof getting a yellow ball = 21\n63= (Why?). Therefore, the probability of getting a red ball is\nmore than that of getting a yellow ball.\nSuppose you spin the wheel\n1.(i) List the number of outcomes of getting a green sector\nand not getting a green sector on this wheel(Fig 4.8).\n(ii) Find the probability of getting a green sector .\n(iii) Find the probability of not getting a green sector .\n4.3.5  Chance and probability related to real life\nWe talked about the chance that it rains just on the day when we do not carry a rain coat.\nWhat could you say about the chance in terms of probability? Could it be one in 10\ndays during a rainy season? The probability that it rains is then 1\n10. The probability that it\ndoes not rain = 9\n10.
