["3.1 The Need for Smaller Units\nSonu\u2019s mother was fixing a \ntoy. She was trying to join two pieces with the help of a screw. Sonu was watching his mother with great curiosity. His mother was unable to join the pieces. Sonu asked why. His mother said that the screw was not of the right size.\nShe brought another screw from the box and was able to fix the toy. \nThe two screws looked the same to Sonu. But when he observed them closely, he saw they were of slightly different lengths.\nSonu was fascinated \nby how such a small difference in lengths could matter so much. He was curious to know the difference in lengths. He was also curious to know how little the difference was because the screws looked nearly the same.\nIn the following figure, screws are placed above a scale. Measure \nthem and write their length in the space provided.\nA PEEK BEYOND \nTHE POINT3\nChapter-3.indd   46Chapter-3.indd   46 4/12/2025   11:39:13 AM4/12/2025   11:39:13 AM\n", "A Peek Beyond the Point\nWhich scale helped you measure the length of the screws accurately? \nWhy? \nWhat is the meaning of 2 7\n10  cm (the length of the first screw)?\nAs seen on the ruler, the unit length between two consecutive \nnumbers is divided into 10 equal parts.

Also, the sum will always be less than 2 more than the sum of their whole number parts.\u201d \nLet us use an example to understand what his claim means: If the two numbers to be added are 25.936 and 8.202, the claim is \nthat their sum will be greater than 25 + 8 (whole number parts) and will be less than 25 + 1 + 8 + 1.\nWhat do you think about this claim? Verify if this is true for these \nnumbers. Will it work for any 2 decimal numbers? \nWhat about for the sum of 25.93603259 and 8.202?Similarly, come up with a way to narrow down the range of whole \nnumbers within which the difference of two decimal numbers will lie. \nNote to the Teacher: Estimating the result before computing may help in identifying if a mistake happens with the calculation. \n3.8 More on the Decimal System\nDecimal and Measurement Disasters\nDecimal point and unit conversion mistakes may seem minor sometimes but they can lead to serious problems.

(1 euro-cent = 1/100 euro).\n\u2022\n In \n1983, a decimal error nearly caused a disaster for an Air Canada \nBoeing 767. The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300 pounds instead of kilograms\u2014about half of what was needed (1 pound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air , forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield. Fortunately, everyone survived.\nSeveral incidents have occurred due to incorrect reading of decimal \nnumbers while giving medication. For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5 mg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed quantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the location of the decimal point.\nDeceptive Decimal Notation\nSarayu gets a message: \u201cThe bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post noon.\u201d When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.? \nNone of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10 \nequal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60 minutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach the station at 4:30.\nHere is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width \nof an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a door 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches (since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn\u2019t close fully.\nI said the door\u2019s \nwidth should be \n2.5 ft.\nIt is 2.5 ft!

Decimal notation, in essentially its modern form, was described in detail in \nKit\u0101b al-Fu\u1e63\u016bl f\u012b al-\u1e24is\u0101b al Hind\u012b (The Book of Chapters on Indian \nArithmetic) by Ab\u016bl \u1e24assan al-Uql\u012bdis\u012b, an Arab mathematician, in \naround 950 CE. He represented the number 0.059375 as 0\n\u02c8 059375.\nIn the 15th century, to separate whole numbers from fractional \nparts, a number of different notations were used:\n\u2022 a vertical mark on the last digit of the whole number part (as \nshown above),\n\u2022 use of different colours and\n\u2022 a numerical superscript giving the number of fractional decimal \nplaces (0.36 would be written as 362\n).\nIn the 16th century, John Napier , a Scottish mathematician, and \nChristopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period \n(\u2018.\u2019) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te, a French mathematician, used the comma (\u2018,\u2019) instead. \nCurrently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer \npart and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5 is written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator). But the decimal point has endured as the most popular notation for writing numbers \nhaving fractional parts in the Indian place value system.\nFigure it Out\n1.
