["10 MATHEMA TICS\n2\n2.1 Introduction\nIn Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall\nthat if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of\nthe polynomial  p(x). For example, 4 x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of\ndegree 1, 2 y2 \u2013 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5 x3 \u2013 4x2 + x \u2013 2\nis a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7 u6 \u2013 423482uu u\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d  is a polynomial\nin the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like 1\n1x\uf02d, 2x\uf02b, 21\n23 xx\uf02b\uf02b etc., are\nnot polynomials.\nA polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial . For example, 2 x \u2013 3,\n35 ,x\uf02b 2 y\uf02b , 2\n11x\uf02d , 3z + 4, 213u\uf02b, etc.,  are all linear polynomials. Polynomials\nsuch as 2 x + 5 \u2013 x2, x3 + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials.\nA polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial . The name \u2018quadratic\u2019\nhas been derived from the word \u2018quadrate\u2019, which means \u2018square\u2019. 2 2, 235xx\uf02b\uf02d\ny2 \u2013 2, 223 ,x x\uf02d\uf02b  22 2 2125 , 5 , 433 7uuv v z\uf02d\uf02b \uf02d \uf02b  are some examples of\nquadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, anyquadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax\n2 + bx  + c, where a, b, c are real numbers\nand a \uf0b9 0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial . Some examples ofPOLYNOMIALS\nReprint 2025-26\n", "POLYNOMIALS 11\na cubic polynomial are 2 \u2013 x3, x3, 32,x 3 \u2013 x2 + x3, 3x3 \u2013 2x2 + x \u2013 1. In fact, the most\ngeneral form of a cubic polynomial is\nax3 + bx2 + cx + d,\nwhere, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a \uf0b9 0.\nNow consider the polynomial p(x) = x2 \u2013 3x \u2013 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the\npolynomial, we get p(2) = 22 \u2013 3 \u00d7 2 \u2013 4 = \u2013 6. The value \u2018\u2013 6\u2019, obtained by replacing\nx by 2 in x2 \u2013 3x \u2013 4, is the value of x2 \u2013 3x \u2013 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of\np(x) at x = 0, which is \u2013 4.\nIf p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by\nreplacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k).\nWhat is the value of p(x) = x2 \u20133x \u2013 4 at x = \u20131? We have :\np(\u20131) = (\u20131)2 \u2013{3 \u00d7 (\u20131)} \u2013 4 = 0\nAlso, note that p(4) = 42 \u2013 (3 \uf0b4 4) \u2013 4 = 0.\nAs p(\u20131) = 0 and p(4) = 0, \u20131 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic\npolynomial x2 \u2013 3x \u2013 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a\npolynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0.\nYou have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear\npolynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us\n2k + 3 = 0, i.e., k = 3\n2\uf02d\uf0d7\nIn general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak + b = 0, i.e., bka\uf02d\uf03d\uf0d7\nSo, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is (Constant term)\nCoefficient ofb\nax\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d .\nThus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this\nhappen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial also related to its coefficients?\nIn this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the\ndivision algorithm for polynomials.\n2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial\nYou know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why\nare the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the\ngeometrical  representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical\nmeaning of their zeroes.\nReprint 2025-26\n", "12 MATHEMA TICS\nConsider first a linear polynomial ax + b, a \uf0b9 0. You have studied in Class IX that the\ngraph of y = ax + b is a straight line. For example, the graph of y = 2x  + 3 is a straight\nline passing through the points (\u2013 2, \u20131) and (2, 7).\nx \u20132 2\ny = 2x + 3 \u20131 7\nFrom Fig. 2.1, you can see\nthat the graph of y = 2 x + 3\nintersects the x-axis mid-way\nbetween x = \u20131 and x  = \u2013 2,\nthat is, at the point 3,02\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf02d\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8.\nYou also know that the zero of\n2x + 3 is 3\n2\uf02d. Thus, the zero of\nthe polynomial 2 x + 3 is the\nx-coordinate of the point where the\ngraph of y = 2x  + 3 intersects the\nx-axis.\nIn general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a \uf0b9 0, the graph of y = ax + b is a\nstraight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely, ,0b\na\uf02d\uf0e6\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8.\nTherefore, the linear polynomial ax + b, a \uf0b9 0, has exactly one zero, namely, the\nx-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis.\nNow, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial.\nConsider the quadratic polynomial x2 \u2013 3x \u2013 4. Let us see what the graph * of\ny = x2 \u2013 3x \u2013 4 looks like. Let us list  a few values of y = x2 \u2013 3x \u2013 4 corresponding to\na few values for x as given in Table 2.1.\n*Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students,\nnor is to be evaluated.Fig. 2.1\nReprint 2025-26\n", "POLYNOMIALS 13\nTable 2.1\nx \u2013  2 \u2013 1 012 3 4 5\ny = x2 \u2013 3x \u2013  46 0\u2013  4\u2013  6\u2013  6 \u2013  4 06\nIf we locate the points listed\nabove on a graph paper and draw\nthe graph, it will actually look like\nthe one given in Fig. 2.2.\nIn fact, for any quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a \uf0b9 0, the\ngraph of the correspondingequation y = ax\n2 + bx + c has one\nof the two shapes either open\nupwards like  or open\ndownwards like  depending on\nwhether a > 0 or a < 0. (These\ncurves are called  parabolas .)\nYou can see from Table 2.1\nthat \u20131 and 4 are zeroes of the\nquadratic polynomial. Also\nnote from Fig. 2.2 that \u20131 and 4\nare the x-coordinates of the points\nwhere the graph of y = x2 \u2013 3x \u2013 4\nintersects the x-axis. Thus, the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomialx\n2 \u2013 3x \u2013 4 are x-coordinates of\nthe points where the graph ofy = x\n2 \u2013 3 x \u2013 4 intersects the\nx-axis.\nThis fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a \uf0b9 0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the\nparabola representing  y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.\nFrom our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c, the\nfollowing three cases can happen:Fig. 2.2\nReprint 2025-26\n", "14 MATHEMA TICS\nCase (i) :  Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A \uf0a2.\nThe x-coordinates of A and A \uf0a2 are the two zeroes  of the quadratic polynomial\nax2 + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).\nFig. 2.3\nCase (ii) :  Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident\npoints. So, the two points A and A\uf0a2 of Case (i) coincide here to become one point \nA\n(see Fig. 2.4).\nFig. 2.4\nThe x-coordinate of A is the only zero  for the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c\nin this case.\nReprint 2025-26\n", "POLYNOMIALS 15\nCase (iii) :  Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below\nthe x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).\nFig. 2.5\nSo, the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c has no zero  in this case.\nSo, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two\ndistinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a\npolynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.\nNow, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic\npolynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x3 \u2013 4x. To see what\nthe graph of y = x3 \u2013 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few\nvalues for x as shown in Table 2.2.\nTable 2.2\nx \u20132 \u20131 0 1 2\ny = x3 \u2013 4x 030 \u2013 3 0\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see\nthat the graph of y = x3 \u2013 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.\nReprint 2025-26\n", "16 MATHEMA TICS\nWe see from the table above\nthat \u2013 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the\ncubic polynomial x3 \u2013 4x . Observe\nthat \u2013 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, thex-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x\n3 \u2013 4 x\nintersects the x-axis. Since the curve\nmeets the x-axis in only these 3\npoints, their x-coordinates are the\nonly zeroes of the polynomial.\nLet us take a few more\nexamples. Consider the cubic\npolynomials x3 and x3 \u2013 x2. We draw\nthe graphs of y = x3 and y = x3 \u2013 x2\nin Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.\nFig. 2.7 Fig. 2.8Fig. 2.6\nReprint 2025-26\n", "POLYNOMIALS 17\nNote that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x3. Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see\nthat 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x3 intersects the\nx-axis. Similarly, since x3 \u2013 x2 = x2 (x \u2013 1),  0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial\nx3 \u2013 x2. Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 \u2013 x2 intersects the x-axis.\nFrom the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic\npolynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.\nRemark :  In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)\nintersects the x-axis at atmost n points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has\nat most n zeroes.\nExample 1 :  Look at the graphs in Fig. 2.9 given below. Each is the graph of y = p(x),\nwhere p(x) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of p(x).\nFig. 2.9\nSolution :\n(i)\nThe number of zeroes is 1 as the graph intersects the x-axis at one point only.\n(ii)The number of zeroes is 2 as the graph intersects the x-axis at two points.\n(iii)The number of zeroes is 3.

Find the\nnumber of zeroes of p(x), in each case.\nFig. 2.10\n2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial\nYou have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial ax + b is b\na\uf02d. We will now try\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,say p(x) = 2 x\n2 \u2013 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\u2018\u2013 8x\u2019 as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 \u00d7 2 x\n2 = 12 x2. So, we write\n2x2 \u2013 8x  + 6 = 2x2 \u2013 6x \u2013 2x + 6 = 2 x(x \u2013 3) \u2013 2( x \u2013 3)\n=( 2x \u2013 2)( x \u2013 3) = 2( x \u2013 1)( x \u2013 3)\nReprint 2025-26\n", "POLYNOMIALS 19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 \u2013 8x + 6 is zero when x \u2013 1 = 0 or x \u2013 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3. So, the zeroes of 2 x2 \u2013 8x + 6 are 1 and 3. Observe that :\nSum of its zeroes =2( 8) (Coefficient of )134\n2 Coefficient ofx\nx\uf02d\uf02d \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\uf03d \uf03d\nProduct of its zeroes =26 Constant term13 3\n2Coefficient of x\uf0b4\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\nLet us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, p(x) = 3 x2 + 5x \u2013 2. By the\nmethod of splitting the middle term,\n3x2 + 5x  \u2013 2 = 3 x2 + 6x \u2013 x \u2013 2 = 3 x(x + 2) \u20131( x + 2)\n=( 3x \u2013 1)( x + 2)\nHence, the value of 3 x2 + 5x \u2013 2 is zero when either 3 x \u2013 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, i.e.,\nwhen x = 1\n3 or x = \u20132.
