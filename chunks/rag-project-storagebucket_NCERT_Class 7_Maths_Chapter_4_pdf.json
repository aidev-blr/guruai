["4.1 The Notion of Letter-Numbers In this chapter we shall look at a concise way of expressing mathematical relations and patterns. We shall see how this helps us in thinking about these relationships and patterns, and in explaining why they may hold true. Example 1: Shabnam is 3 years older than Aftab. When Aftab\u2019s age 10 years, Shabnam\u2019s age will be 13 years. Now Aftab\u2019s age is 18 years, what will Shabnam\u2019s age be? _______ Given Aftab\u2019s age, how will you find out Shabnam\u2019s age? Easy: We add 3 to Aftab\u2019s age to get Shabnam\u2019s age.Can we write this as an expression? Shabnam\u2019s age is 3 years more than Aftab\u2019s. In short, this can be written as: Shabnam\u2019s age = Aftab\u2019s age + 3. Such mathematical relations are generally represented in a shorthand form. In the relation above, instead of writing the phrase \u2018Aftab\u2019s Age\u2019, the convention is to use a convenient symbol. Usually, letters or short phrases are used for this purpose. Let us say we use the letter a to denote Aftab\u2019s age (we could have used any other letter), and s to denote Shabnam\u2019s age. Then the expression to find Shabnam\u2019s age will be a + 3, which can be written as s = a + 3. If a is 23 (Aftab\u2019s age in years), then what is Shabnam\u2019s age?Expression for Shabnam\u2019s age 4 + 3 10 + 3 23 + 3 ? + 3 a + 3Aftab\u2019s age 4 10 23 ? a Fig. 4.1EXPRESSIONS USING LETTER-NUMBERS4 Chapter-4.indd 81Chapter-4.indd 81 4/11/2025 7:30:05 PM4/11/2025 7:30:05 PM", "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Replacing a by 23 in the expression a + 3, we get, s = 23 + 3 = 26 years. Letters such as a and s that are used to represent numbers are called letter-numbers. Mathematical expressions containing letter-numbers, such as the expression a + 3, are called algebraic expressions. Given the age of Shabnam, write an expression to find Aftab\u2019s age. We know that Aftab is 3 years younger than Shabnam. So, Aftab\u2019s age will be 3 less than Shabnam\u2019s. This can be described as Aftab\u2019 s age = Shabnam\u2019s age \u2013 3. If we again use the letter a to denote Aftab\u2019s age and the letter s to denote Shabnam\u2019s age, then the algebraic expression would be: a = s \u2013 3, meaning 3 less than s . Use this expression to find Aftab\u2019s age if Shabnam\u2019s age is 20. Example 2: Parthiv is making matchstick patterns. He repeatedly places Ls next to each other . Each L has two matchsticks as shown in Figure 4.2. Fig. 4.2 How many matchsticks are needed to make 5 Ls? It will be 5 \u00d7 2.How many matchsticks are needed to make 7 Ls? It will be 7 \u00d7 2.How many matchsticks are needed to make 45 Ls? It will be 45 \u00d7 2. Now , what is the relation between the number of Ls and the number of sticks?First, let us describe the relationship or the pattern here. Every L needs 2 matchsticks. So the number of matchsticks needed will be 2 times the number of L\u2019s. This can be written as: Number of matchsticks = 2 \u00d7 Number of L\u2019s Now, we can use any letter to denote the number of L\u2019s. Let\u2019s use n . The algebraic expression for the number of matchsticks will be: 2 \u00d7 n . This expression tells us how many matchsticks are needed to make n L\u2019s. To find the number of matchsticks, we just replace n by the number of L. Example 3: Ketaki prepares and supplies coconut-jaggery laddus. The price of a coconut is \u20b935 and the price of 1 kg jaggery is \u20b960. 82 Chapter-4.indd 82Chapter-4.indd 82 4/11/2025 7:30:05 PM4/11/2025 7:30:05 PM", "Expressions Using Letter-Numbers How much should she pay if she buys 10 coconuts and 5 kg jaggery? Cost of 10 coconuts = 10 \u00d7 \u20b935 Cost of 5 kg jaggery = 5 \u00d7 \u20b960Total cost = 10 \u00d7 \u20b935 + 5 \u00d7 \u20b960 = \u20b9350 + \u20b9300 = \u20b9650. How much should she pay if she buys 8 coconuts and 9 kg jaggery? Write an algebraic expression to find the total amount to be paid for a given number of coconuts and quantity of jaggery. Let us identify the relationships and then write the expressions. Quantity needed Relationship Expression Cost of coconuts Number of coconuts \u00d7 35c \u00d7 35 Cost of jaggery Number of kgs of jaggery \u00d7 60j \u00d7 60 Here, \u2018c \u2019 represents the number of coconuts and \u2018j \u2019 represents the number of kgs of jaggery. The total amount to be paid will be: Cost of coconuts + Cost of jaggery. The corresponding algebraic expression can be written as: c \u00d7 35 + j \u00d7 60 Use this expression (or formula) to find the total amount to be paid for 7 coconuts and 4 kg jaggery. Notice that for different values of \u2018c \u2019 and \u2018j \u2019, the value of the expression also changes. Writing this expression as a sum of terms we get: + c \u00d7 35 j \u00d7 60 Example 4: We are familiar with calculating the perimeters of simple shapes. Write expressions for perimeters. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of its side. This can be written as the expression: 4 \u00d7 q , where q stands for the sidelength. What is the perimeter of a square with sidelength 7 cm? Use the expression to find out. You must have realised how the use of letter-numbers and algebraic expressions allows us to express general mathematical relations in 83 Chapter-4.indd 83Chapter-4.indd 83 4/11/2025 7:30:05 PM4/11/2025 7:30:05 PM", "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 a concise way.

Many times they could have been read in multiple ways and it was confusing. We used swapping (adding two numbers in any order) and grouping (adding numbers by grouping them conveniently) to find easy ways of evaluating expressions. Swapping and grouping terms does not change the value of the expression. We also learnt to use brackets in expressions, including brackets with a negative sign outside. We learnt the distributive property (multiple of a sum is the same as sum of multiples). Let us revise these concepts and find the values of the following expressions: 1. 23 \u2013 10 \u00d7 2 2. 83 + 28 \u2013 13 + 32 3. 34 \u2013 14 + 20 4. 42 + 15 \u2013 (8 \u2013 7) 5. 68 \u2013 (18 + 13) 6. 7 \u00d7 4 + 9 \u00d7 6 7. 20 + 8 \u00d7 (16 \u2013 6) Let us evaluate the first expression, 23 \u2013 10 \u00d7 2. First we shall write the terms of the expression. Notice that one of the terms is a number , while the other one has to be converted to a number before adding the two terms. 23 \u2013 10 \u00d7 2 = 23 + \u201310 \u00d7 2 = 23 + \u201320 = 3w \u2013 1 w 85 Chapter-4.indd 85Chapter-4.indd 85 4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM", "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Let us now evaluate the second one. All the terms of this expression are numbers. If we notice the terms, we find that it will be easier to evaluate if we swap and group the terms. 83 + 28 \u2013 13 + 32 = Let us now look at the fifth expression. It has brackets with a negative sign outside. This can be evaluated in two ways \u2014 by solving the bracket first (like the solution on the left side) or by removing the brackets appropriately (as on the right side). Now, find the values of the other arithmetic expressions. Algebraic expressions also take number values when the letter- numbers they contain are replaced by numbers. In Example 1, for finding Shabnam\u2019s age when Aftab is 23 years old, we replaced the letter-number a in the expression a + 3 by 23, and it took the value 26. 4.3 Omission of the Multiplication S ymbol in Algebraic Expressions Look at this number sequence: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ... How can we describe this sequence or pattern? Easy: These are the numbers appearing in the multiplication table of 4 (multiples of 4 in an increasing order). What is the third term of this sequence? It is 4 \u00d7 3.What is the 29th term of this sequence? It is 4 \u00d7 29. Find an algebraic expression to get the nth term of this sequence. Note that here \u2018n \u2019 is a letter-number that denotes a position in the sequence.83 28 \u201313 32 + + + 70 60 130 = + = 37 =68 \u2013(18 + 13) = + 68 \u201331 = +68 \u2013(18 + 13) = + 50 \u201313 37 = + =68 \u201318 \u201313 = + + OR 86 Chapter-4.indd 86Chapter-4.indd 86 4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM", "Expressions Using Letter-Numbers As it is the sequence of multiples of 4, it can be seen that the nth term will be 4 times n : 4 \u00d7 n As a standard practice, we shorten 4 \u00d7 n to 4n by skipping the multiplication sign. We write the number first, followed by the letter(s). Find the value of the expression 7k when k = 4. The value is 7 \u00d7 4 = 28. Find the value that the expression 5m + 3 takes when m = 2. As 5m stands for 5 \u00d7 m , the value of the expression when m = 2 is 5 \u00d7 2 + 3 = 13. Mind the Mistake, Mend the Mistake Some simplifications are shown below where the letter-numbers are replaced by numbers and the value of the expression is obtained. 1. Observe each of them and identify if there is a mistak e. 2. If you think there is a mistak e, try to explain what might have gone wrong. 3. Then, correct it and give the value of the expression. 4.4 Simplification of Algebraic Expressions Earlier we found expressions to find perimeters of different regular figures in terms of their sides. Let us now find an expression to find the perimeter of a rectangle. 1 If a = \u2013 4, then 10 \u2013 a = 6.2 If d = 6, then 3d = 36.3 If s = 7, then 3s \u2013 2 = 15. 4 If r = 8, then 2r + 1 = 29.5 If j = 5, then 2j = 10.6 If m = \u20136, then 3 (m + 1) = 19. 7 If f = 3, g = 1 then 2f \u2013 2g = 2.8 If t = 4, b = 3 then 2t + b = 24.9 If h = 5, n = 6 then h \u2013 (3 \u2013 n ) = 4. 87 Chapter-4.indd 87Chapter-4.indd 87 4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM", "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 As in the previous cases, we will first describe how to get the perimeter when the length and the breadth of the rectangle are known: Find the sum of length + breadth + length + breadth. Let us use the letter-numbers l and b in place of length and breadth respectively. Let p denote the perimeter of the rectangle. Then we have p = l + b + l + b As we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an expression can be added in any order . Hence the above expression can be written as: = l + l + b + b As l + l = 2 \u00d7 l = 2l , and b + b = 2 \u00d7 b = 2b , we have p = 2l + 2b . Notice that the initial expression (l + b + l + b) and the final expression (2l + 2b ) that we got for the perimeter look different. However , they are equal since the expression was obtained from the initial one by applying the same rules and operations we do for numbers; they are equal in the sense that they both take the same values when letter-numbers are replaced by numbers. For example, if we assign l = 3, b = 4, we get l + b + l + b = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14, and 2l + 2b = 2 \u00d7 3 + 2 \u00d7 4 = 14. We call the expression 2l + 2b the simplified form of l + b + l + b. Let us see some more examples of simplification. Example 5: Here is a table showing the number of pencils and erasers sold in a shop. The price per pencil is c, and the price per eraser is d. Find the total money earned by the shopkeeper during these three days. Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Pencils (Price \u2018c \u2019)5 3 10 Erasers (Price \u2018d \u2019)4 6 1 Let us first find the money earned by the sale of pencils. The money earned by selling pencils on Day 1 is 5c . Similarly, the money earned by selling pencils on Day 2 is _____, and Day 3 is ______. The total money earned by the sale of pencils is 5c + 3c + 10c . Can we simplify this expression further and reduce the number of terms? 88 Chapter-4.indd 88Chapter-4.indd 88 4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM", "Expressions Using Letter-Numbers The expression means 5 times c is added to 3 times c is added to 10 times c. So in total, the letter-number c is added (5 + 3 + 10) times. This is what we have seen as the distributive property of numbers. Thus, 5 \u00d7 c + 3 \u00d7 c + 10 \u00d7 c = (5 + 3 + 10) \u00d7 c (5 + 3 + 10) \u00d7 c can be simplified to 18 \u00d7 c = 18c . If c = \u20b950, find the total amount earned by the scale of pencils. Write the expression for the total money earned by selling erasers. Then, simplify the expression. The expression for the total money earned by selling pencils and erasers during these three days is 18c + 11d . Can the expression 18c + 11d be simplified further? There is no way of further simplifying this expression as it contains different letter-numbers. It is in its simplest form. In this problem, we saw the expression 5c + 3c + 10c getting simplified to the expression 18c . Check that both expressions take the same value when c is replaced by different numbers. Example 6: A big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown. Write an expression describing the area of the bigger rectangle. The areas of the smaller rectangles are 4v sq. units and 3v sq. units. The area of the bigger rectangle can be found in two ways: (i) by directly using its side lengths v and (4 + 3), or (ii) by adding the areas of the smaller rectangles. The first way gives 7v , and the second way gives 4v + 3v . We know that they are equal: 4v + 3v = 7v , and this is the required expression for the area of the bigger rectangle. As earlier , a big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown below. Write an expression to find the area of the rectangle AEFD. Another way of seeing the distributive property. 3 4v 89 Chapter-4.indd 89Chapter-4.indd 89 4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM", "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Even in this case, the area of rectangle AEFD can be found in two ways: (i) by directly using the side lengths n and (12 \u2013 4), or (ii) subtracting the area of the rectangle EBCF from that of ABCD. The first method gives us 8n, and the second method gives us 12n \u2013 4n , and they are equal, since 12n \u2013 4n = 8n . This is the expression for the area of the rectangle AEFD. Sets of terms such as (5c , c, 10c ), (12n , \u2013 4n ) that involve the same letter-numbers are called like terms. Sets of terms such as {18c , 11d } are called unlike terms as they have different letter-numbers. As we have seen, like terms can be added together and simplified into a single term. Example 7: A shop rents out chairs and tables for a day\u2019s use. To rent them, one has to first pay the following amount per piece. When the furniture is returned, the shopkeeper pays back some amount as follows. Write an expression for the total number of rupees paid if x chairs and y tables are rented. For x chairs and y tables, let us find the total amount paid at the beginning and the amount one gets back after returning the furniture. Describe the procedure to get these amounts. The total amount in rupees paid at the beginning is 40x + 75y , and the total amount returned is 6x + 10y . So, the total amount paid = (40x + 75y ) \u2013 (6x + 10y ). Can we simplify this expression? If yes, how? If not, why not?4 C BF ED A 12n Item Amount Chair \u20b940 Table \u20b975 Amount returned Chair \u20b96 Table \u20b910 Math Talk 90 Chapter-4.indd 90Chapter-4.indd 90 4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM", "Expressions Using Letter-Numbers Recalling how we open brackets in an arithmetic expression, we get (40x + 75y ) \u2013 (6x + 10y ) = (40x + 75y ) \u2013 6x \u2013 10y Since the terms can be added in any order , the remaining bracket can be opened and the expression becomes 40x + 75y + \u2013 6x + \u2013 10y We can group the like terms together, This results in 40x + \u2013 6x + 75y + \u2013 10y = (40 \u2013 6)x + (75 \u2013 10)y = 34x + 65y . The expression (40x + 75y ) \u2013 (6x + 10y ) is simplified to 34x + 65y , which is the total amount paid in rupees.

Here, we continue to look for general relationships between quantities in different scenarios, find patterns and, interestingly, even explain why these patterns occur .

It appears for the first time at position 3, the second time at position 6. Where would design C appear for the nth time? We can see that this design appears in positions that are multiples of 3. So the nth occurrence of Design C will be at position 3n. Similarly, find the formula that gives the position where the other Designs appear for the nth time. The positions where B occurs are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on.We can see that the position of the nth appearance of Design B is one less than the position at which Design C appears for the n th time. Thus, the nth occurrence of Design B is at position: 3n \u2013 1 Similarly, the expression describing the position at which the design A appears for the nth time is: 3n \u2013 2. Given a position number can we find out the design that appears there? Which Design appears at Position 122? If the position is a multiple of 3, then clearly we have Design C. As seen earlier , if the position is one less than a multiple of 3, it has Design B, and if it is 2 less than a multiple of 3, then it has Design A. Can the remainder obtained by dividing the position number by 3 be used for this? Observe the table below. Position no.

Will the diagonal sums be equal in every 2 \u00d7 2 square in this endless grid? How can we be sure? To be sure of this we cannot check with all 2 \u00d7 2 squares as there are an unlimited number of them. Let us consider a 2 \u00d7 2 square. Its top left number can be any number . Let us call it \u2018a\u2019. Given that we know the top left number , how do we find the other numbers in this 2 \u00d7 2 square?

So the other numbers in the 2 \u00d7 2 square can be represented as shown in the grid. Let us find the diagonal sums; a + (a + 8), and (a + 1) + (a + 7). Let us simplify them.Since the terms can be added in any order , the brackets can be opened. a + (a + 8) = a + a + 8 = 2a + 8 (a + 1) + (a + 7) = a + 1 + a + 7 = a + a + 1 + 7 = 2a + 8 We see that both diagonal sums are equal to 2a + 8 (8 more than 2 times a ). Verify this expression for diagonal sums by considering any 2 \u00d7 2 square and taking its top left number to be \u2018a \u2019. Thus, we have shown that diagonal sums are equal for any value of a, i.e., for any 2 \u00d7 2 square! Consider a set of numbers from the calendar (having endless rows) forming under the following shape: Find the sum of all the numbers. Compare it with the number in the centre: 15.

Can you tell how many matchsticks there will be in the next step, Step 5? It is 11. You can also draw this and see. How many matchsticks will there be in Step 33, Step 84, and Step 108? Of course, we can draw and count, but is there a quicker way to find the answers using the pattern present here? What is the general rule to find the number of matchsticks in the next step?

For step y , what is the expression? It is: one less than y (i.e. y \u2013 1) 2s and a 3. Therefore, the expression is 3 + 2 \u00d7 (y \u2013 1). This expression gives the number of matchsticks in Step y . Now we can find the number of matchsticks at any step quickly. You might have already noticed that there is a 2 in the first step also, 3 = 1 + 2. Using this, the expression we get is 2y + 1. Does the above expression also give the number of matchsticks at each step correctly? Are these expressions the same?
