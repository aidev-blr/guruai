Land, as you may have noticed, has many forms and features; its appearance changes a lot from one region to another . Suppose that you are travelling by road from the region known as Chhota Nagpur in Jharkhand, reach Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, and go on to Almora in Uttarakhand. On the way, you will see very different landscapes. In fact, you will encounter three major landforms, which we will now explore. LET\u2019S EXPLORE \u00c6As a class activity, form groups of four or five students and observe the school\u2019s surroundings. What kind of landscape do you see? Will the landscape change a few kilometres away? Or within some 50 kilometres? Compare with other groups. \u00c6In the same groups, discuss a journey that any of you has made through a region of India. List the different landscapes seen on the way. Compare with other groups. A landform is a physical feature on the surface of our planet Earth. Landforms take shape over millions of years and have a significant connection with the environment and life. They can broadly be divided into three categories \u2014 mountains, plateaus and plains (Fig. 3.1). These landforms have different climates and are home to a variety of flora and fauna. Humans have adapted to all landforms, but the number of people living on different kinds of landforms varies throughout the world. Mountains Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the surrounding landscape. They can be recognised by a broad base, steep slopes and a narrow summit. Depending on their height, some mountains are covered with snow. At lower altitudes, the snow melts every summer and turns Altitude: The height of an object above sea level. Examples: the altitude of a mountain, the altitude of a bird or plane in flight, the altitude of a satellite. chapter3_161224.indd 42chapter3_161224.indd 42 03-02-2025 04:57:2203-02-2025 04:57:22 Reprint 2025-26", "43 3 \u2013 Landforms and LifeFig. 3.1.

At high altitudes, the snow may never melt, leaving the mountain permanently snow-capped. Other highlands with a lower height, less steep slopes and rounded tops are called hills. THINK ABOUT IT What is snow? Unless you live in a Himalayan region (such as Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh), you may never have seen snow! In the rest of India, most precipitation is in the form of rain and hail. But at higher altitudes, if it is cold enough, snow will fall, covering the landscape in a soft and beautiful white blanket. Snow and hailstones are nothing but precipitation of water in a solid state.

Fig. 3.3 brings them together to give a visual impression of their relative heights from top to bottom. Mount Everest (between Tibet (China) and Nepal) and Kanchenjunga (between Nepal and the Indian state of Sikkim) are the two highest peaks of the Himalayan range. Mount Aconcagua (in South America) is the highest peak of the Andes. Mount Kilimanjaro in eastern Africa is an isolated mountain that is not part of any range. Mont Blanc in Western Europe is the highest mountain of the Alps.

Shorter and more rounded mountains and hills, like the Aravalli Range, are much older and have been rounded by erosion. Sometimes, as with the Himalayas, upliftment as well as erosion continue to this day. (You will learn more in Science about such processes and their causes; let us just say here that some mountains of the world, like the Himalayas, are still growing in height.) Mountain environment Mountain slopes are often covered with a type of forest called montane forest, where conifer trees such as pines, firs, spruce and deodar are common. These conifer trees grow tall and cone-shaped, with thin, pointed leaves. At higher altitudes, the trees give way to grasses, mosses and lichen.Montane forest: A type of forests that grows in mountainous regions. Moss: A small green plant without flowers or true roots, often spreading in a cushion-like cover. Lichen: A plant-like organism that generally clings to rocks, walls or tree. Here are two verses from a long poem by K\u0101lid\u0101sa, who lived at least 1,500 years ago and is often considered to be the greatest poet of ancient India. The poem, Kum\u0101rasambhava, begins with an invocation to the Himalayas. (This is a simplified translation from the Sanskrit.) In the north rises Him\u0101laya, the Lord of mountains, like a living god, who measures the Earth and stretches from the western to the eastern oceans. \u2026 From it the wind comes down, carrying spray from descending Gang\u0101, shaking the deodar trees, opening the peacocks\u2019 tail feathers and cooling the mountain people after they hunt deer .

This is called terrace farming. In many mountainous regions of the world, herding is the preferred occupation over agriculture. Tourism is often an important source of income for the people living in the mountains. The crisp mountain air and scenic beauty attract many tourists. Some tourists also go to the mountains for sports such as skiing, hiking, mountaineering and paragliding. For many centuries, people have also travelled to these uplands for pilgrimages to holy sites. But an excessive inflow of visitors can also put the fragile mountain environment under pressure; it is often difficult to find the right balance.

Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world at 8,849 m, has many names. Tibetans call it \u2018Chomolungma\u2019, which means \u2018Mother Goddess of the World\u2019 and worship the mountain as such. Nepalis call it \u2018Sagarmatha\u2019, meaning \u2018Goddess of the Sky\u2019. Similarly, Mount Kailash in Tibet is held sacred by followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon (an ancient Tibetan religion). Such reverence for mountain summits is also found elsewhere in India, as well as in other parts of the world. Plateaus A plateau is a landform that rises up from the surrounding land and has a more or less flat surface; some of its sides are often steep slopes. Like mountains, plateaus can be young or old in terms of the Earth\u2019s history. Two examples of plateaus are the Tibetan Plateau, the largest and highest plateau in the world, and the Deccan Plateau. The height of plateaus can vary from a few hundred metres to several thousand metres. DON\u2019T MISS OUT \u0093 The Tibetan Plateau has an average altitude of 4,500 m, which explains wh y it has been nicknamed the \u2018Roof of the World\u2019! From east to west, it is nearly 2,500 km long \u2014 the distance from Chandigarh to Kanyakumari. \u0093 The Deccan Plateau of central and south India is one of the oldest plateaus in the world, formed through volcanic activity millions of years ago. Like mountains, plateaus are rich in mineral deposits; they have been called \u2018storehouses of minerals\u2019. As a result, mining is a major activity on plateaus, where many of the world\u2019s largest mines are found. For example, the East chapter3_161224.indd 51chapter3_161224.indd 51 03-02-2025 04:57:4903-02-2025 04:57:49 Reprint 2025-26", "52Exploring Society: India and Beyond India and the World: Land and the PeopleAfrican Plateau is famous for gold and diamond mining. In India, huge reserves of iron, coal and manganese are found in the Chhota Nagpur Plateau. The plateau environment is very diverse across the world. Many plateaus have a rocky soil, which makes them less fertile than plains (see next section) and therefore less favourable to farming. An exception is that of lava plateaus (that is, formed through volcanic activity), as they often have a rich black soil. Plateaus are also home to many spectacular waterfalls. The Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River in southern Africa, the Hundru Falls on the Subarnarekha River in the Chhota Nagpur Plateau and the Jog Falls on the Sharavati River in the Western Ghats are a few such waterfalls.

They do not have any large hills or deep valleys. They are generally not more than 300 metres above sea level. Floodplains are one type of plains formed by rivers originating in mountain ranges, where they collect particles of rock, sand and silt called \u2018sediments\u2019. These sediments are carried all the way to the plains, where the rivers deposit them, making the soil very fertile. As a result, these plains are ideal for growing crops of all kinds, and agriculture is a major economic occupation in this landform. Plains also support a variety of flora and fauna.

Food crops such as rice, wheat, maize, barley and millets are grown. Fibre crops such as cotton, jute and hemp are also grown in the Gangetic plain. Traditional agriculture has been mostly rainfed (that is, watered through rainfall). In recent decades, however , agriculture has turned to irrigation, with water brought to the fields through networks of canals or pumped from groundwater . While irrigation has increased agricultural production, it has also contributed to the depletion (or decrease) of groundwater . This presents a challenge for the future of agriculture in the region. Some of the other problems affecting the Ganga plains include high population and pollution. Whether in mountain ranges or plains, rivers around the world have carried immense cultural value. In particular , many communities have considered a river\u2019s source and its confluence with one or two other rivers to be sacred. In India, numerous festivals, ceremonies and rituals are conducted at such locations. Because plains have a gentle slope, river navigation is easy and supports a lot of economic activities. In earlier days, people also used rivers extensively to travel from one place to another . Even today (Fig. 3.10 on page 56), there are stretches along the Ganga where people prefer to use boats to move around!

But its surface is very complex and experts often define a few more landforms. One such landform is the desert. Deserts are considered to be large and dry expanses with very little precipitation. Their flora and fauna are also unique. Some deserts are hot, like the Sahara Desert in Africa or the Thar Desert in the northwest of the Indian Subcontinent. Others are cold, like the Gobi Desert in Asia. (Some experts also describe the Antarctica continent as a desert.) Despite harsh living conditions, humans have adapted to most of the deserts. In India, communities living in the Thar Desert, or migrating through it, hold rich cultural traditions, such as folk songs and legends, related to the desert.
