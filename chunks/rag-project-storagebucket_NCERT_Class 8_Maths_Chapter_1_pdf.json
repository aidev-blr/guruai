["RATIONAL NUMBERS 1 1.1 Introduction In Mathematics, we frequently come across simple equations to be solved. For example, the equation x + 2 = 13 (1) is solved when x = 11, because this value of x satisfies the given equation. The solution 11 is a natural number . On the other hand, for the equation x + 5 = 5 (2) the solution gives the whole number 0 (zero). If we consider only natural numbers, equation (2) cannot be solved. To solve equations like (2), we added the number zero to the collection of natural numbers and obtained the whole numbers. Even whole numbers will not be sufficient to solve equations of type x + 18 = 5 (3) Do you see \u2018why\u2019? We require the number \u201313 which is not a whole number . This led us to think of integers, (positive and negative) . Note that the positive integers correspond to natural numbers. One may think that we have enough numbers to solve all simple equations with the available list of integers. Now consider the equations 2x =3 (4) 5 x + 7 = 0 (5) for which we cannot find a solution from the integers . (Check this) We need the numbers 3 2 to solve equation (4) and 7 5\u2212 to solve equation (5). This leads us to the collection of rational numbers . We have already seen basic operations on rational numbers. We now try to explore some properties of operations on the dif ferent types of numbers seen so far .Rational NumbersCHAPTER1 Reprint 2024-25", "2 MATHEMA TICS 1.2 Properties of Rational Numbers 1.2.1 Closure (i)Whole numbers Let us revisit the closure property for all the operations on whole numbers in brief.

(iii) Rational numbers Recall that a number which can be written in the form p q, where p and q are integers and q \u2260 0 is called a rational number . For example, 2 3\u2212, 6 7, 9 5\u2212 are all rational numbers. Since the numbers 0, \u20132, 4 can be written in the form p q, they are also rational numbers. (Check it!)

Which will not? 1.2.6 Distributivity of multiplication over addition for rational numbers To understand this, consider the rational numbers 3 2,4 3\u2212 and 5 6\u2212. \u2212\u00d7 +\u2212\uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f1 \uf8f2\uf8f3\uf8fc \uf8fd\uf8fe3 42 35 6 =\u2212\u00d7+ \u2212 \uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\uf8fc\uf8fd\uf8fe3 44 5 6( ) ( ) =\u2212\u00d7\u2212\uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f73 41 6 = 3 1 24 8= Also3 2 4 3\u2212\u00d7 =3 2 6 1 4 3 12 2\u2212 \u00d7 \u2212 \u2212= =\u00d7 Reprint 2024-25", "12 MATHEMA TICS Example 3: Find2 3 1 3 3 5 7 14 7 5\u2212\u00d7 \u2212 \u2212 \u00d7 Solution:2 3 1 3 3 5 7 14 7 5\u2212\u00d7 \u2212 \u2212 \u00d7 =2 3 3 3 1 5 7 7 5 14\u2212\u00d7 \u2212 \u00d7 \u2212 (by commutativity) =2 53 73 73 51 14\u00d7\u2212+\u2212\uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u00d7 \u2212 =\u2212+\uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u22123 72 53 51 14(by distributivity) =3 117 14\u2212\u00d7 \u2212 = 6 1 1 14 2\u2212 \u2212 \u2212= EXERCISE 1.1 1.Name the property under multiplication used in each of the following.
