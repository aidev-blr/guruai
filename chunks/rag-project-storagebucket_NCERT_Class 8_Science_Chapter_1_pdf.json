["As we look at our surr oundings, we see a lar ge variety of things with dif ferent shapes, sizes and textur es. Everything in this universe is made up of material which scientists have named \u201cmatter\u201d. The air we br eathe, the food we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and animals, even a small dr op of water or a particle of sand \u2014 every thing is matter . We can also see as we look around that all the things mentioned above occupy space and have mass. In other words, they have both mass* and volume**. Since early times, human beings have been trying to understand their surr oundings. Early Indian philosophers classified matter in the form of five basic elements \u2014 the \u201cPanch Tatva\u201d \u2014 air , earth, fir e, sky and water . According to them everything, living or non- living, was made up of these five basic elements. Ancient Gr eek philosophers had arrived at a similar classification of matter . Moder n day scientists have evolved two types of classification of matter based on their physical properties and chemical natur e. In this chapter we shall lear n about matter based on its physical pr operties. Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up in subsequent chapters. 1.1 Physical Nature of Matter 1.1.1 M ATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES For a long time, two schools of thought prevailed regarding the natur e of matter . One school believed matter to be continuous like a block of wood, wher eas, the other thought that matter was made up of particles like sand. Let us perform an activity to decide about the natur e of matter \u2014 is it continuous or particulate?Activity ______________ 1.1 \u2022Take a 100 mL beaker . \u2022Fill half the beaker with water and mark the level of water . \u2022Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help of a glass r od. \u2022Observe any change in water level. \u2022What do you think has happened to the salt? \u2022Wher e does it disappear? \u2022Does the level of water change? In or der to answer these questions we need to use the idea that matter is made up of particles. What was ther e in the spoon, salt or sugar , has now spr ead thr oughout water . This is illustrated in Fig. 1.1. 1.1.2 HOW SMALL ARE THESE PARTICLES OF MATTER ?

Why and how? From the above thr ee activities (1.3, 1.4 and 1.5), we can conclude the following:Fig. 1.2: Estimating how small ar e the particles of matter . With every dilution, though the colour becomes light, it is still visible. This experiment shows that just a few crystals of potassium per manganate can colour a lar ge volume of water (about 1000 L). So we conclude that there must be millions of tiny particles in just one crystal of potassium permanganate, which keep on dividing themselves into smaller and smaller particles. The same activity can be done using 2 mL of Dettol instead of potassium permanganate. The smell can be detected even on repeated dilution. The particles of matter are very small \u2013 they ar e small beyond our imagination!!!! 1.2Characteristics of Particles of Matter 1.2.1 PARTICLES OF MATTER HAVE SPACE BETWEEN THEM In activities 1.1 and 1.2 we saw that particles of sugar , salt, Dettol, or potassium permanganate got evenly distributed in water . Similarly, when we make tea, cof fee or lemonade ( nimbu paani ), particles of one type of matter get into the spaces between particles of the other . This shows that ther e is enough space between particles of matter .

Which property of matter does this observation show? 4.What are the characteristics of the particles of matter?Particles of matter are continuously moving, that is, they possess what we call the kinetic ener gy. As the temperatur e rises, particles move faster . So, we can say that with increase in temperatur e the kinetic ener gy of the particles also incr eases. In the above thr ee activities we observe that particles of matter inter mix on their own with each other . They do so by getting into the spaces between the particles. This intermixing of particles of two dif ferent types of matter on their own is called dif fusion. W e also observe that on heating, dif fusion becomes faster . Why does this happen? 1.2.3 PARTICLES OF MATTER ATTRACT EACH OTHER Activity ______________ 1.6 \u2022Play this game in the field\u2014 make four groups and for m human chains as suggested: \u2022The first group should hold each other from the back and lock arms like Idu-Mishmi dancers (Fig. 1.3).

Why?Q Reprint 2025-26", "SCIENCE 41.3States of Matter Observe different types of matter around you. What ar e its dif ferent states? W e can see that matter ar ound us exists in thr ee dif ferent states\u2013 solid, liquid and gas. These states of matter arise due to the variation in the characteristics of the particles of matter . Now, let us study about the pr operties of these thr ee states of matter in detail. 1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE Activity _____________ 1.9 \u2022Collect the following articles \u2014 a pen, a book, a needle and a piece of wooden stick. \u2022Sketch the shape of the above articles in your notebook by moving a pencil around them. \u2022Do all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and a fixed volume? \u2022What happens if they are hammered, pulled or dr opped? \u2022Are these capable of dif fusing into each other? \u2022Try compr essing them by applying force. Ar e you able to compr ess them? All the above ar e examples of solids. W e can observe that all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes, that is, have negligible compr essibility. Solids have a tendency to maintain their shape when subjected to outside for ce. Solids may br eak under for ce but it is dif ficult to change their shape, so they ar e rigid. Consider the following: (a)What about a rubber band, can it change its shape on str etching? Is it a solid? (b)What about sugar and salt? When kept in dif ferent jars these take the shape of the jar . Are they solid? (c)What about a sponge? It is a solid yet we ar e able to compr ess it. Why? All the above ar e solids as: \u2022A rubber band changes shape under force and regains the same shape whenthe force is removed. If excessive force is applied, it breaks. \u2022The shape of each individual sugar or salt crystal r emains fixed, whether we take it in our hand, put it in a plate or in a jar. \u2022A sponge has minute holes, in which air is trapped, when we pr ess it, the air is expelled out and we ar e able to compr ess it. 1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE Activity _____________ 1.10 \u2022Collect the following: (a)water , cooking oil, milk, juice, a cold drink. (b)containers of dif ferent shapes. Put a 50 mL mark on these containers using a measuring cylinder fr om the laboratory. \u2022What will happen if these liquids ar e spilt on the floor? \u2022Measur e 50 mL of any one liquid and transfer it into dif ferent containers one by one. Does the volume r emain the same? \u2022Does the shape of the liquid r emain the same ? \u2022When you pour the liquid fr om one container into another , does it flow easily? We observe that liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume. They take up the shape of the container in which they ar e kept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they are not rigid but can be called fluid. Refer to activities 1.4 and 1.5 wher e we saw that solids and liquids can dif fuse into liquids. The gases fr om the atmosphere diffuse and dissolve in water . These gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, ar e essential for the survival of aquatic animals and plants. All living cr eatur es need to br eathe for survival. The aquatic animals can br eathe under water due to the pr esence of dissolved oxygen in water . Thus, we may conclude that solids, liquids and gases can diffuse into liquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is Reprint 2025-26", "MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDING S 5higher than that of solids. This is due to the fact that in the liquid state, particles move freely and have greater space between each other as compared to particles in the solid state. 1.3.3 THE GASEOUS STATE Have you ever observed a balloon seller filling a lar ge number of balloons fr om a single cylinder of gas? Enquire fr om him how many balloons is he able to fill fr om one cylinder . Ask him which gas does he have in the cylinder . Activity _____________ 1.11 \u2022Take thr ee 100 mL syringes and close their nozzles by rubber corks, as shown in Fig.1.4. \u2022Remove the pistons fr om all the syringes. \u2022Leaving one syringe untouched, fill water in the second and pieces of chalk in the thir d. \u2022Insert the pistons back into the syringes. Y ou may apply some vaseline on the pistons befor e inserting them into the syringes for their smooth movement. \u2022Now, try to compr ess the content by pushing the piston in each syringe.We have observed that gases ar e highly compr essible as compared to solids and liquids. The liquefied petr oleum gas (LPG) cylinder that we get in our home for cooking or the oxygen supplied to hospitals in cylinders is compr essed gas. Compr essed natural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days in vehicles. Due to its high compr essibility, large volumes of a gas can be compr essed into a small cylinder and transported easily. We come to know of what is being cooked in the kitchen without even entering ther e, by the smell that r eaches our nostrils. How does this smell reach us? The particles of the aroma of food mix with the particles of air spread fr om the kitchen, r each us and even farther away. The smell of hot cooked food reaches us in seconds; compare this with the rate of dif fusion of solids and liquids. Due to high speed of particles and lar ge space between them, gases show the pr operty of diffusing very fast into other gases. In the gaseous state, the particles move about randomly at high speed. Due to this random movement, the particles hit each other and also the walls of the container . The pressur e exerted by the gas is because of this force exerted by gas particles per unit ar ea on the walls of the container . Fig. 1.4 \u2022What do you observe? In which case was the piston easily pushed in? \u2022What do you infer fr om your observations? Fig.1.5: a, b and c show the magnified schematic pictur es of the thr ee states of matter . The motion of the particles can be seen and compar ed in the thr ee states of matter .

We all know fr om our observation that water can exist in thr ee states of matter\u2013 \u2022solid, as ice, \u2022liquid, as the familiar water , and \u2022gas, as water vapour . What happens inside the matter during this change of state? What happens to the particles of matter during the change of states? How does this change of state take place? W e need answers to these questions, isn\u2019t it?Q (a) (b) Fig. 1.6: (a) Conversion of ice to water , (b) conversion of water to water vapour Reprint 2025-26", "MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDING S 7\u2022Start heating the beaker on a low flame. \u2022Note the temperature when the ice starts melting. \u2022Note the temperatur e when all the ice has converted into water . \u2022Recor d your observations for this conversion of solid to liquid state. \u2022Now, put a glass r od in the beaker and heat while stirring till the water starts boiling. \u2022Keep a car eful eye on the ther mometer reading till most of the water has vaporised. \u2022Recor d your observations for the conversion of water in the liquid state to the gaseous state. On increasing the temperatur e of solids, the kinetic ener gy of the particles incr eases. Due to the incr ease in kinetic ener gy, the particles start vibrating with gr eater speed. The ener gy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles. The particles leave their fixed positions and start moving mor e freely. A stage is reached when the solid melts and is converted to a liquid. The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K *. The process of melting, that is, change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion. When a solid melts, its temperature remains the same, so where does the heat energy go? You must have observed, during the experiment of melting, that the temperatur e of the system does not change after the melting point is reached, till all the ice melts. This happens even though we continue to heat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply heat. This heat gets used up in changing thestate by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles. As this heat energy is absorbed by ice without showing any rise in temperatur e, it is consider ed that it gets hidden into the contents of the beaker and is known as the latent heat. The wor d latent means hidden. The amount of heat ener gy that is r equir ed to change 1 kg of a solid into liquid at atmospheric pr essur e at its melting point is known as the latent heat of fusion. So, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more energy as compared to particles in ice at the same temperature. When we supply heat ener gy to water , particles start moving even faster . At a certain temperatur e, a point is r eached when the particles have enough energy to break fr ee from the forces of attraction of each other . At this temperatur e the liquid starts changing into gas. The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pr essur e is known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles fr om the bulk of the liquid gain enough ener gy to change into the vapour state. For water this temperature is 373 K (100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K). Can you define the latent heat of vaporisation? Do it in the same way as we have defined the latent heat of fusion. Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at 373 K (1000 C) have mor e ener gy than water at the same temperatur e. This is because particles in steam have absorbed extra ener gy in the for m of latent heat of vaporisation. *Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after rounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you have to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.So, we infer that the state of matter can be changed into another state by changing the temperature. We have lear nt that substances ar ound us change state fr om solid to liquid and fr om liquid to gas on application of heat. But there Reprint 2025-26", "SCIENCE 8enclosed in a cylinder? Will the particles come closer? Do you think that increasing or decreasing the pressure can change the state of matter?are some that change directly from solid state to gaseous state and vice versa without changing into the liquid state. Activity _____________ 1.13 \u2022Take some camphor . Crush it and put it in a china dish. \u2022Put an inverted funnel over the china dish. \u2022Put a cotton plug on the stem of the funnel, as shown in Fig. 1.7. * atmospher e (atm) is a unit of measuring pr essur e exerted by a gas. The unit of pr essur e is Pascal (Pa): 1 atmospher e = 1.01 \u00d7 105 Pa. The pr essur e of air in atmospher e is called atmospheric pr essur e. The atmospheric pr essur e at sea level is 1 atmospher e, and is taken as the nor mal atmospheric pr essur e. Fig. 1.7: Sublimation of camphorFig. 1.8: By applying pressure, particles of matter can be brought close together Applying pressure and reducing temperatur e can liquefy gases. Have you hear d of solid carbon dioxide (CO2)? It is stor ed under high pr essur e. Solid CO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state on decr ease of pr essur e to 1 atmospher e* without coming into liquid state. This is the reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known as dry ice. Thus, we can say that pr essur e and temperature deter mine the state of a substance, whether it will be solid, liquid or gas.\u2022Now, heat slowly and observe. \u2022What do you infer from the above activity? A change of state directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid state is called sublimation and the direct change of gas to solid without changing into liquid is called deposition. 1.4.2 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE We have alr eady lear nt that the dif ference in various states of matter is due to the difference in the distances between the constituent particles.

You must have observed that the rate of evaporation increases with\u2013 \u2022an increase of surface area: We know that evaporation is a surface phenomenon. If the surface area is increased, the rate of evaporation increases. F or example, while putting clothes for drying up we spread them out. \u2022an increase of temperature: With the increase of temperature, more number of particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapour state. \u2022a decrease in humidity: Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in air . The air around us cannot hold more than a definite amount of water vapour at a given temperature. If the amount of water in air is already high, the rate of evaporation decreases. \u2022an increase in wind speed: It is a common observation that clothes dry faster on a windy day . With the increase in wind speed, the particles of water vapour move away with the wind, decreasing the amount of water vapour in the surrounding. 1.5.2 HOW DOES EVAPORATION CAUSE COOLING ? In an open vessel, the liquid keeps on evaporating. The particles of liquid absorb energy from the surrounding to regain the energy lost during evaporation. This absorption of energy from the surroundings make the surroundings cold.uestions 1.Convert the following temperature to celsius scale: a. 300 K b. 573 K 2.What is the physical state of water at: a. 250oC b. 100oC ? 3.For any substance, why does the temperature remain constant during the change of state? 4.Suggest a method to liquefy atmospheric gases. 1.5 Evaporation Do we always need to heat or change pressure for changing the state of matter? Can you quote some examples from everyday life where change of state from liquid to vapour takes place without the liquid reaching the boiling point? W ater, when left uncovered, slowly changes into vapour . Wet clothes dry up. What happens to water in the above two examples? We know that particles of matter are always moving and are never at rest. At a given temperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there are particles with different amounts of kinetic energy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction of particles at the surface, having higher kinetic energy, is able to break away from the forces of attraction of other particles and gets converted into vapour . This phenomenon of change of liquid into vapours at any temperature below its boiling point is called evaporation. 1.5.1 FACTORS AFFECTING EVAPORATION Let us understand this with an activity .

The particles gain energy from your palm or surroundings and evaporate causing the palm to feel cool. After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle water on the r oof or open gr ound because the lar ge latent heat of vaporisation of water helps to cool the hot sur face. Can you cite some mor e examples fr om daily life wher e we can feel the ef fect of cooling due to evaporation? Why should we wear cotton clothes in summer? During summer , we perspir e mor e because of the mechanism of our body which keeps us cool. W e know that during evaporation, the particles at the sur face of the liquid gain energy fr om the surr oundings or body sur face and change into vapour . The heat ener gy equal to the latent heat of vaporisation is absorbed fr om the body leaving the body cool.
