["1.1 A Lakh Varieties! Eshwarappa is a farmer in Chintamani, a town in Karnataka. He visits the market regularly to buy seeds for his rice field. During one such visit he overheard a conversation between Ramanna and Lakshmamma. Ramanna said, \u201cEarlier our country had about a lakh varieties of rice. Farmers used to preserve different varieties of seeds and use them to grow rice. Now, we only have a handful of varieties. Also, farmers have to come to the market to buy seeds\u201d. Lakshmamma said, \u201cThere is a seed bank near my house. So far , they have collected about a hundred indigenous varieties of rice seeds from different places. You can also buy seeds from there.\u201d You may have heard the word \u2018lakh\u2019 before. Do you know how big one lakh is? Let us find out. Eshwarappa shared this incident with his daughter Roxie and son Estu . Estu was surprised to know that there were about one lakh varieties of rice in this country. He wondered \u201cOne lakh! So far I have only tasted 3 varieties. If we tried a new variety each day, would we even come close to tasting all the varieties in a lifetime of 100 years?\u201d What do you think? Guess.

Its height is about 180 metres. \u2022 K unchikal waterfall in Karnataka is said to drop from a height of about 450 metres. It is not always easy to get a sense of how big these measurements are. But, we can get a better sense of their size when we compare them with something familiar . Let us see an example. Look at the picture on the right. Somu is 1 metre tall. If each floor is about four times his height, what is the approximate height of the building? Which is taller \u2014 The Statue of Unity or this building? How much taller? ____________m.

The table below shows some numbers according to both the Indian system and the American system (also called the International system) of naming numerals and placing commas. Observe the placement of commas in both systems. Indian System American System 1,000 One thousand 1,000 One thousand 10,000 Ten thousand 10,000 Ten thousand 1,00,000 One lakh 100,000 Hundred thousand 10,00,000 Ten lakhs 1,000,000 One million 1,00,00,000 One crore 10,000,000 Ten million 10,00,00,000 Ten crores 100,000,000 Hundred million 1,00,00,00,000 One arab or One hundred crores1,000,000,000 One billion Notice that in the Indian system, commas are placed to group the digits in a 3-2-2-2... pattern from right to left (thousands, lakhs, crores, etc.). In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a 3-3-3-3\u2026 pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.). The Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and Myanmar . The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words lak\u1e63ha ( \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937) and ko\u1e6di (\u0915\u094b\u091f\u093f\u200d). The American system is also used in many countries. Observe the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore. 1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes. 1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes. A lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a lakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand is 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).

Have you read or heard such headlines or statements? Very often, exact numbers are not required and just an approximation is sufficient. For example, according to the 2011 census, the population of Chintamani town is 76,068. Instead, saying that the population is about 75,000 is enough to give an idea of how big the quantity is. Bappi, call and check if Toofan Express is on time. What number did you call? I called the rounded off number , of course! My teacher told us that efficient people deal with rounded off numbers. There are situations where it makes sense to round up a number (rounding up is when the approximated number is more than the actual number). For example, if a school has 732 people including students, teachers and staff: the principal might order 750 sweets instead of 700 sweets. There are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down is when the approximated number is less than the actual number). For example, if the cost of an item is \u20b9470, the shopkeeper may say that the cost is around \u20b9450 instead of saying it is around \u20b9500.

While thinking about these, he came up with an unusual question, \u201cCould the entire population of Mumbai fit into 1 lakh buses?\u201d What do you think? How can we find out?Let us assume a bus can accommodate 50 people. Then 1 lakh buses can accommodate 1 lakh \u00d7 50 = 50 lakh people. 18 Chapter-1.indd 18Chapter-1.indd 18 4/12/2025 12:13:55 PM4/12/2025 12:13:55 PM", "Large Numbers Around Us The population of Mumbai is more than 1 crore 24 lakhs (we saw this in an earlier table). So, the entire population of Mumbai cannot fit in 1 lakh buses. The RMS Titanic ship carried about 2500 passengers. Can the population of Mumbai fit into 5000 such ships? Inspired by this strange question, Roxie wondered, \u201cIf I could travel 100 kilometers every day, could I reach the Moon in 10 years?\u201d (The distance between the Earth and the Moon is 3,84,400 km.) How far would she have travelled in a year?How far would she have travelled in 10 years?Is it not easier to perform these calculations in stages? You can use this method for all large calculations. Find out if you can reach the Sun in a lifetime, if you travel 1000 kilometers every day. (You had written down the distance between the Earth and the Sun in a previous exercise.) Make necessary reasonable assumptions and answer the questions below: (a) If a single sheet of paper weighs 5 gr ams, could you lift one lakh sheets of paper together at the same time? (b) If 250 babies are born every minute across the world, will a million babies be born in a day? (c) Can you count 1 million coins in a day? Assume you can count 1 coin every second.
