His father left him large tracts of land when he died. But Rama Natha did not spend even one day looking after his land. This was because he had a funny idea\u2014he believed there was a magic potion that could turn any object into gold. He spent all his time to learn more about this potion. People cheated him often, promising to tell him about it, but he did not give up . His wife, Madhumati, was tired of this and also worried because she saw how much money Rama Natha was spending. She was sure that soon they would be without money. One day, a famous sage called Mahipati came to their town. Rama Natha became his follower and asked him about the potion. To his surprise the sage answered, \u201cYes, in my travels in the Himalayas, I heard how you could make such a potion. But it is difficult.\u201d \u201cTell me!\u201d requested Rama Natha, not believing his luck. \u201cYou have to plant a banana plant and water it regularly with your hands. In winter, the morning dew is on the leaves. You have to collect the dew and store it in a bottle. When you have five litres of dew, bring it to me. I will chant some magic words, which will turn it into the magic potion. A drop of the potion will change any object into gold.\u201dlarge tracts of land: large areas of land potion : a liquid with magical properties give up: stop trying dew: small drops of water on leaves that form during night chant: to repeat or sing a word or phrase Unit 1.indd 2 09-Dec-24 3:47:58 PM Reprint 2025-26", "3 Rama Natha was worried. \u201cBut winter is only for a few months.

There he planted rows and rows of banana plants. He tended them carefully and during the winter months collected the dew that formed on them with great care. His wife helped him too. Madhumati gathered the banana crop, took it to the market and got a good price for it. Over the years, Rama Natha planted more and more plants and they had a huge banana plantation.

To his surprise nothing happened! \u201cThis is cheating,\u201d he told the sage. \u201cI have wasted six precious years of my life.\u201d But sage Mahipati only smiled and called Madhumati to come forward. She came with a big box. When she opened it, inside shined stacks of gold coins! Now the sage turned to the very surprised Rama Natha and said, \u201cThere is no magic potion that can turn things into gold. You worked hard on your land and created this plantation. While you looked after the trees, your wife sold the fruits in the market. That\u2019s how you got this money. It was your hard work that created this wealth, not magic. If I had told you about this earlier, you would have not listened to me, so I played a trick on you.\u201d Rama Natha understood the wisdom behind these words and worked even harder on his plantation from that day on. sudha MurTymuttered : spoke in a low voice wisdom : deep understandingprecious : valuable Let us discuss 1.
